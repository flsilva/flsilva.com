textile:
  Welcome to my blog.

  In recent years I've studied a lot and have realized that writing is a great way to learn better. So, I've written some articles in the past few years and will be posting here, alongside new ones that I'll be writing. I'll be writing mostly about subjects that are part of my everyday work, mainly on web and mobile development (e.g. Ruby, Rails, HTML5, JavaScript, iOS, Android, Web Server, etc). Usually the articles will be licensed under a creative commons license.

  The source code and assets of this website are publicly available, but they are copyrighted unless otherwise stated. The source can be found at: <a href="http://github.com/flsilva/flsilva.com" target="_blank">http://github.com/flsilva/flsilva.com</a>

  I invite everyone to cooperate and share ideas, whether through comments or pull requests. Keep in mind that english is not my native language, and I have a lot to learn to achieve fluency. I appreciate any corrections, as I'll try to learn with each one.

  Also, if you want to say hello, discuss a project, share some idea or whatever, feel free to <a id="blog-post-welcome-contact-button" href="/contact/">get in touch</a>.

  Thanks for visiting.
