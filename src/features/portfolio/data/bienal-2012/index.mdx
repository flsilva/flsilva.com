[Grafikonstruct](https://www.linkedin.com/company/grafikonstruct/) hired me to design and implement a back-end solution comprised of a custom CMS and a RESTful JSON API to be consumed by a front-end mobile web application developed by their internal team.

I've built the client-side application of the CMS from scratch as a single-page app in [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org), resulting in a superior User Experience (for the time being). The back-end app was built in [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org) and deployed to [EngineYard](https://www.engineyard.com).

Some technologies used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AngularJS, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, and EngineYard.
