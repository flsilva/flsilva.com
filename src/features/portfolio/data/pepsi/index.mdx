I designed and implemented the application architecture, the "Home" screen using [Papervision3D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papervision3D), and the "Mapa do Site" (Sitemap) screen and mentored other developers and motion designers to implement and integrate the remaining screens and UI components.

The front-end app pulled dynamic data from an XML API.

Some technologies used: Adobe Flash, ActionScript 3.0, and XML.
