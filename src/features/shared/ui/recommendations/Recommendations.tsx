          Flavio is both fast and thorough. But I was particularly struck by the
          deep thoughtfulness and helpfulness he brought to the team, and by the
          smile and positive spirit he shared, every day.

          Flavio not only has superb communication skills, but he&#39;s also a
          proactive problem solver. He will go above and beyond what is asked of
          him to make sure the team and the project will succeed.

          Flavio came in a freelance developer to help us develop a large
          platform MVP for a client. He proved himself beyond valuable in ideas
          and execution. I would recommend him for any project challenge, as he
          will rise to the occasion.
