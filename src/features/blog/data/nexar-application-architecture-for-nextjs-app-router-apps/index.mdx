I'm excited to announce [Nexar](https://nexar.dev), an application architecture designed for Next.js App Router apps.

## What is Nexar?

Nexar is a [modular](/blog/what-is-software-architecture#modules-and-modular-architectures) and [layered](/blog/what-is-software-architecture#layers-and-layered-architectures) application architecture to develop scalable, maintainable, and well-organized monolith codebases with the new Next.js App Router.

I designed it to be straightforward, minimal, and pragmatic while offering [the benefits of application architectures](/blog/what-is-software-architecture#why-software-architecture-is-important).

## Why Nexar?

<InfoBoxQuotation>
  A well-defined architecture helps developers understand the system and their
  role in building it. It promotes effective communication, collaboration, and
  alignment with business goals across different teams while enforcing clear
  conventions.
</InfoBoxQuotation>

Engineering teams work better and faster when they agree on a specific, well-defined architecture that fits their use case. Nexar provides that, assuming it fits your use case.

## OpenTask: an open-source reference implementation

I designed Nexar while building [OpenTask](/blog/building-opentask-nextjs-app-router-react-server-components/), an [open-source](https://github.com/flsilva/opentask) and responsive task management web application MVP created for fun and learning the new Next.js App Router.

You can browse [OpenTask's codebase](https://github.com/flsilva/opentask) to see how it implements Nexar in its tiny details.

## Collaboration

I invite you to read Nexar's [docs](https://nexar.dev/learn), [join the discussion](https://github.com/flsilva/nexar.dev/discussions), and share your thoughts. Let's evolve it together.
