<InfoBox>
  This is **Part 7** of the "Mastering Relational Database Design" series. In
  [Part 6](LINK_HERE), we learned how to model the various types of
  relationships that exist in database systems using primary and foreign keys.
</InfoBox>

## Introduction

Business rules define how an organization operates, establishing policies and procedures that govern its activities. In database design, these rules must be embedded in the system to ensure data integrity, consistency, and validity—no matter how the data is accessed or manipulated. Constraints and validation tables are two powerful mechanisms for implementing business rules directly in your database structure.

In this article, we'll explore how to effectively implement business rules through database constraints and validation tables. We'll examine various constraint types and demonstrate how validation tables provide flexibility and maintainability when enforcing complex business rules.

<InfoBoxQuotation>
  Database constraints serve as guardrails that enforce business rules directly
  at the data layer. This minimizes the risk of invalid data entering the system
  and ensures consistent enforcement across all applications and users.
</InfoBoxQuotation>

Business rules examples for ShopSmart:

- A product price must never be negative.
- An order status must be one of a predefined set (e.g., 'pending', 'processing', 'shipped', 'delivered', 'cancelled').
- A customer email address must be unique across all customers.
- A product must belong to a valid category.
- Inventory stock quantity cannot fall below zero.
- Customers must be at least 13 years old to register.

## Types of constraints

While primary keys and foreign keys (which we covered in previous articles) are fundamental constraints, several other types of constraints can enhance your database design by implementing specific business rules.

Let's explore the main types of constraints available in most relational database systems, with a focus on PostgreSQL implementation.

### 1. Not Null constraint

The _`NOT NULL`_ constraint ensures that a column cannot contain null values, forcing users to provide a value when inserting or updating records.

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
  name varchar(100) NOT NULL,
  description text NOT NULL,
  price numeric(10,2) NOT NULL,
  -- other fields
);
```

This constraint prevents products from being created without essential information like a name, description, or price.

When to use `NOT NULL`:

- For required fields that must always have a value.
- For primary key columns.
- For columns used in critical calculations or business operations.
- When the absence of a value would make the record meaningless.

<InfoBox>
  When deciding whether a column should allow null values, consider what a null
  actually means in that context. Does null mean "unknown," "not applicable,"
  "not yet provided," or something else? Being explicit about this meaning helps
  determine whether nulls should be allowed.
</InfoBox>

### 2. Unique constraints

Unique constraints ensure the uniqueness of column values across rows. They're commonly used for alternate keys and business identifiers like SKUs, email addresses, or product codes.

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
  sku varchar(50) UNIQUE,
  -- other fields
);
```

This prevents duplicate SKUs within the products table.

Unique constraints can also span multiple columns:

```sql
CREATE TABLE product_warehouse_inventory (
  product_id uuid REFERENCES products(product_id),
  warehouse_id uuid REFERENCES warehouses(warehouse_id),
  quantity integer NOT NULL,
  -- Composite unique constraint
  CONSTRAINT unique_product_warehouse UNIQUE (product_id, warehouse_id)
);
```

This ensures that a product appears only once per warehouse in the inventory table.

When to use unique constraints:

- For business identifiers like email addresses, SKUs, or account numbers.
- For natural keys (identifiers that have meaning in the real world).
- For columns or column combinations that should never contain duplicates.
- For implementing alternate keys.

### 3. Check constraints

Check constraints validate column values against boolean conditions. They're extremely versatile and can implement a wide range of business rules.

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
  product_id uuid DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  price numeric(10,2) CHECK (price >= 0),
  weight numeric(8,3) CHECK (weight > 0),
  stock_quantity integer CHECK (stock_quantity >= 0)
);
```

These constraints prevent invalid entries like negative prices, weights, or stock quantities.

Check constraints can also reference multiple columns:

```sql
CREATE TABLE promotions (
  promotion_id uuid DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  started_at timestamp NOT NULL,
  ended_at timestamp NOT NULL,
  -- Multi-column check constraint
  CONSTRAINT check_promotion_dates CHECK (ended_at > started_at)
);
```

This ensures the end date always comes after the start date.

When to use check constraints:

- For validating value ranges (e.g., positive numbers, age limits).
- For enforcing data formats (e.g., pattern matching with _`LIKE`_ or regex).
- For implementing business rules that can be expressed as boolean conditions.
- For ensuring logical consistency between columns.

<InfoBox>
  Named constraints (like _`CONSTRAINT check_promotion_dates`_) make debugging
  easier. When a constraint is violated, the error message includes the
  constraint name, helping identify which business rule was broken.
</InfoBox>

### 4. Exclusion constraints

PostgreSQL offers exclusion constraints, a powerful feature for enforcing more complex rules involving multiple rows:

```sql
CREATE TABLE room_bookings (
  booking_id uuid DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  room_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES rooms(room_id),
  booked_from timestamp NOT NULL,
  booked_until timestamp NOT NULL,
  -- Prevent overlapping bookings for the same room
  CONSTRAINT no_overlapping_bookings EXCLUDE USING gist (
    room_id WITH =,
    tsrange(booked_from, booked_until) WITH &&
  )
);
```

This constraint prevents booking the same room for overlapping time periods, using PostgreSQL's range types and GiST indexes.

When to use exclusion constraints:

- For time-based scheduling and reservation systems.
- For spatial applications where objects cannot overlap.
- For any scenario where certain combinations across rows are forbidden.
- For implementing complex business rules involving ranges or sets.

### 5. Deferred constraints

Standard constraints are checked immediately when a statement executes. However, sometimes you need to temporarily violate a constraint during a transaction before fixing it later. PostgreSQL supports deferrable constraints for these scenarios:

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
  order_id uuid DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  -- other fields
);

CREATE TABLE order_items (
  order_item_id uuid DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  order_id uuid NOT NULL,
  product_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES products(product_id),
  quantity integer NOT NULL,
  -- Deferrable foreign key constraint
  CONSTRAINT fk_order_items_order FOREIGN KEY (order_id)
    REFERENCES orders(order_id) DEFERRABLE INITIALLY IMMEDIATE
);
```

With this setup, you can defer constraint checking until the transaction commits:

```sql
BEGIN;
SET CONSTRAINTS fk_order_items_order DEFERRED;

-- This would normally violate the foreign key constraint
-- because the order doesn't exist yet
INSERT INTO order_items (order_id, product_id, quantity)
VALUES ('new-order-id', 'product-123', 1);

-- But now we can create the order with the matching ID
INSERT INTO orders (order_id)
VALUES ('new-order-id');

-- At COMMIT time, the constraint will be checked and pass
COMMIT;
```

When to use deferred constraints:

- For mutual dependencies between tables.
- For inserting parent and child records in arbitrary order.
- For complex data migration scenarios.
- For implementing circular references.

### 6. Triggers for complex constraints

For business rules that can't be expressed with standard constraints, database triggers provide a way to implement custom validation logic that runs automatically when data changes:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION check_order_amount()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  -- If the order total exceeds $10,000, require manager approval
  IF (SELECT SUM(quantity * unit_price) FROM order_items WHERE order_id = NEW.order_id) > 10000
    AND NEW.manager_approval_id IS NULL THEN
    RAISE EXCEPTION 'Orders exceeding $10,000 require manager approval';
  END IF;
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER enforce_manager_approval
BEFORE UPDATE OF status ON orders
FOR EACH ROW
WHEN (NEW.status = 'processing')
EXECUTE FUNCTION check_order_amount();
```

This trigger enforces a business rule that large orders require manager approval before they can be processed.

<InfoBox theme="warning">
  While triggers are powerful, they can make database behavior less transparent
  and harder to debug. Use them sparingly, only when simpler constraints won't
  suffice. Consider documenting them thoroughly in your schema documentation.
</InfoBox>

When to use triggers for constraints:

- When the validation depends on data in other tables.
- For constraints that need to perform calculations.
- When you need to perform actions beyond just validation.
- For enforcing complex temporal rules or state transitions.

## Validation tables

Validation tables—also called lookup tables or reference tables—store predefined sets of values that other tables can reference. They act as centralized repositories for standard codes, types, statuses, and classifications, helping enforce data consistency across your database while improving system maintainability.

<InfoBoxQuotation>
  Validation tables elevate data integrity from the field level to the domain
  level by ensuring that certain fields only contain values from an approved
  set.
</InfoBoxQuotation>

Common examples include tables for order statuses (e.g., _Pending_, _Shipped_, _Delivered_) or product categories (e.g., _Electronics_, _Clothing_, _Books_).

Validation tables typically have at least two columns:

- A primary key.
- A name or description column (displayed to users).

Optionally, they may also include metadata like display order, abbreviations, or an active/inactive flag.

### Check constraints vs. validation tables

For simple validation of a limited set of values, you could use a check constraint:

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
  order_id uuid DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  status varchar(20) NOT NULL,
  -- other fields
  CONSTRAINT chk_order_status CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'processing', 'shipped', 'delivered', 'cancelled'))
);
```

While simple, this method has several limitations:

- It hard-codes allowed values into the schema.
- Adding new status options requires changing the schema.
- It doesn't support additional metadata about each status.
- It doesn't facilitate translations or descriptions.
- It can't be easily queried or referenced by applications.

### Implementing a validation table

Let's see how to implement a validation table for order statuses:

```sql
CREATE TABLE order_statuses (
  order_status_id uuid DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  name varchar(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  description text,
  display_order integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  is_active boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT true,
  created_at timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Populate with initial values
INSERT INTO order_statuses (name, description, display_order)
VALUES
  ('pending', 'Order has been placed but not yet processed', 10),
  ('processing', 'Order is being prepared for shipment', 20),
  ('shipped', 'Order has been shipped', 30),
  ('delivered', 'Order has been delivered', 40),
  ('cancelled', 'Order has been cancelled', 50);

-- Update orders table to reference the validation table
CREATE TABLE orders (
  order_id uuid DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  order_status_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES order_statuses(order_status_id),
  -- other fields
);
```

Now the _`orders`_ table has a foreign key to the _`order_statuses`_ table, ensuring that orders can only use status values that exist in the validation table.

### Benefits of validation tables

This approach offers several advantages over check constraints:

1. **User interface integration**: The validation table can easily populate dropdown menus in application interfaces..
2. **UI-driven updates**: Adding new status options no longer requires schema changes—you can simply insert new rows into the validation table through a user interface.
3. **Extensibility**: You can include metadata like descriptions, display order, and status for each value.
4. **Localization support**: You can add columns for translations or create related translation tables.
5. **Performance**: Lookups using indexed foreign keys are faster and more efficient than repeated string comparisons.
6. **Referential integrity**: Foreign key constraints ensure that invalid values cannot be used.

### Real-world validation table example

Let's implement a more comprehensive example for our ShopSmart ecommerce database. Earlier in the series, we introduced a self-referencing many-to-many relationship between products through a _`related_products`_ table, with a _`relationship_type`_ field to describe how products are related.

We initially enforced this business rule:

- Product relationships must be categorized as "accessory", "alternative", or "frequently bought together".

Instead of using a check constraint, let's create a validation table:

```sql
-- Create the validation table
CREATE TABLE product_relationship_types (
  product_relationship_type_id uuid DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  name varchar(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  description text,
  display_order integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  is_active boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT true,
  created_at timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Populate with valid values
INSERT INTO product_relationship_types (name, description, display_order)
VALUES
  ('accessory', 'Products that complement the main product', 10),
  ('alternative', 'Similar products that could substitute the main product', 20),
  ('frequently_bought_together', 'Products often purchased together with the main product', 30);

-- Create the related_products table with a foreign key to the validation table
CREATE TABLE related_products (
  related_product_id uuid DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  product_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES products(product_id),
  related_to_product_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES products(product_id),
  product_relationship_type_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES product_relationship_types(product_relationship_type_id),
  created_at timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  CONSTRAINT chk_different_products CHECK (product_id <> related_to_product_id)
);

-- Create an index to improve lookup performance
CREATE INDEX idx_related_products_type
ON related_products(product_relationship_type_id);
```

### Common validation tables in an ecommerce system

For our ShopSmart database, several validation tables would be valuable:

1. **Order statuses**: The states an order can be in (pending, processing, shipped, etc.)
2. **Payment methods**: Types of payment (credit card, PayPal, bank transfer, etc.)
3. **Shipping methods**: Delivery options (standard, express, same-day, etc.)
4. **Product categories**: Classifications for products
5. **Address types**: Types of addresses (shipping, billing, both)
6. **Product relationship types**: How products relate to each other
7. **User roles**: Customer, administrator, support staff, etc.
8. **Return reasons**: Reasons for returning products
9. **Tax categories**: For different tax treatment of products
10. **Countries and regions**: For shipping and tax calculations

Each of these validation tables centralizes a set of valid values, making the system more maintainable and flexible.

## Best practices for constraints and validation tables

### For constraints

1. **Name your constraints explicitly**: This helps with debugging and documentation.

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE products ADD CONSTRAINT products_price_check CHECK (price >= 0);
   ```

2. **Balance database vs. application validation**: Implement critical business rules at the database level, but consider performance impacts for complex validations.

3. **Test constraint behavior thoroughly**: Ensure constraints work as expected by testing boundary cases and error handling.

4. **Document constraints**: Maintain clear documentation about what business rules each constraint enforces.

5. **Consider deferrable constraints**: For complex transactions with interdependent inserts or updates.

### For validation tables

1. **Include audit columns**: Track when values were added and by whom.

2. **Use soft deletes**: Instead of removing values, mark them as inactive to preserve referential integrity.

3. **Consider internationalization needs**: Design validation tables to support multiple languages if needed.

4. **Add display metadata**: Include fields like _`display_order`_ to help applications present values in a logical sequence.

5. **Create common patterns**: Standardize your validation table structure across your database.

<InfoBox>
  A good pattern for validation tables includes:

- A UUID primary key
- A unique name/code (used programmatically)
- A description (user-friendly explanation)
- A display order field (for UI presentation)
- An active/inactive flag (for soft deletes)
- Audit fields (created_at, updated_at)
  <br />
</InfoBox>

## Building a validation framework

For larger systems with many validation tables, consider building a standardized framework:

```sql
-- Create a schema for validation tables
CREATE SCHEMA validation;

-- Create a base table definition
CREATE TABLE validation.base_validation_type (
  id uuid DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  name varchar(100) NOT NULL,
  description text,
  display_order integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  is_active boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT true,
  created_at timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  created_by varchar(100) NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_USER,
  updated_at timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_by varchar(100) NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_USER
);

-- Create specific validation tables that inherit from the base
CREATE TABLE validation.order_statuses (
  CONSTRAINT order_statuses_name_unique UNIQUE (name)
) INHERITS (validation.base_validation_type);

CREATE TABLE validation.payment_methods (
  CONSTRAINT payment_methods_name_unique UNIQUE (name)
) INHERITS (validation.base_validation_type);

-- And so on for other validation types
```

This approach provides consistency across all validation tables while allowing for type-specific extensions when needed.

## Enforcing complex business rules

Some business rules require combinations of constraints and validation tables. Let's explore a few examples:

### Example 1: product pricing rules

Imagine we have a rule that subscription products can't have a price below $5.99:

```sql
-- First, create a product_types validation table
CREATE TABLE product_types (
  product_type_id uuid DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  name varchar(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  description text,
  display_order integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  is_active boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT true
);

INSERT INTO product_types (name, description)
VALUES
  ('physical', 'Tangible products that require shipping'),
  ('digital', 'Downloadable products'),
  ('subscription', 'Recurring service products');

-- Then add a check constraint that references the validation table
ALTER TABLE products
ADD CONSTRAINT check_subscription_price
CHECK (
  product_type_id != (SELECT product_type_id FROM product_types WHERE name = 'subscription')
  OR price >= 5.99
);
```

### Example 2: restricted product categories

Some product categories might have age restrictions:

```sql
-- Add an age_restriction field to the categories table
ALTER TABLE categories ADD COLUMN minimum_age integer;

-- Then use a trigger to enforce the rule
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION enforce_age_restriction()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  IF EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM categories c
    JOIN products p ON c.category_id = p.category_id
    JOIN order_items oi ON p.product_id = oi.product_id
    JOIN orders o ON oi.order_id = o.order_id
    JOIN customers cust ON o.customer_id = cust.customer_id
    WHERE oi.order_id = NEW.order_id
    AND c.minimum_age IS NOT NULL
    AND (
      cust.birth_date IS NULL OR
      cust.birth_date > CURRENT_DATE - (c.minimum_age * INTERVAL '1 year')
    )
  ) THEN
    RAISE EXCEPTION 'Order contains age-restricted products that customer is not eligible to purchase';
  END IF;
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER check_age_restrictions
BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE ON orders
FOR EACH ROW
WHEN (NEW.status = 'processing')
EXECUTE FUNCTION enforce_age_restriction();
```

### Example 3: promotional rules

For a "buy one, get one free" promotion, we might need a combination of validation tables and application logic:

```sql
CREATE TABLE promotion_types (
  promotion_type_id uuid DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  name varchar(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  description text,
  display_order integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  is_active boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT true
);

INSERT INTO promotion_types (name, description)
VALUES
  ('percentage_discount', 'Percentage off the product price'),
  ('fixed_amount_discount', 'Fixed amount off the product price'),
  ('buy_x_get_y_free', 'Buy a certain quantity, get additional items free');

-- This particular rule might be too complex for pure SQL constraints
-- and would likely involve application logic along with these validation tables
```

## Key takeaways

- **Database constraints** are the first line of defense for enforcing business rules.
- **NOT NULL constraints** ensure required data is always provided.
- **UNIQUE constraints** prevent duplicate values across records.
- **CHECK constraints** validate field values against boolean conditions.
- **Validation tables** centralize sets of allowed values for reference by other tables.
- **Named constraints** improve error messages and maintainability.
- **Triggers** can implement complex rules that span multiple tables or rows.
- **Good validation table design** includes metadata beyond just the values themselves.
- **A standardized approach** to constraints and validation tables improves consistency.
- **Complex business rules** often require combinations of different constraint types.

## Next up in the series

In the next article, [Subtype Tables (Inheritance)](LINK_HERE) we'll explore how to implement inheritance-like structures in relational databases. We'll look at techniques for modeling entity subtypes, such as different types of products (physical, digital, subscription) with their own unique attributes, while maintaining a unified interface to the base entity type.
