          I'm a Brazilian Full-Stack Software Engineer with 18 years of professional industry experience building full-stack web & mobile applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started my professional career in 2004, and I've been working remotely from home since 2009 and exclusively for overseas companies and startups since 2013, mainly in the U.S.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've been leading front-end teams since 2007. First on-site, then remotely, working with CEOs, CTOs, managers, and designers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since 2018 I have specialized in building cross-platform React apps by implementing a single, responsive codebase. Then, we build it as native iOS and Android apps and as web apps for mobile and desktop browsers. Many businesses can benefit from such a tech strategy by drastically reducing costs and time to market.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have experience with advanced software engineering practices, including Software Architecture, Testing, CI/CD, Agile, and modern technology such as TypeScript, React, React Native, Design Systems, Jest, Node.js, Next.js, Remix, AWS AppSync, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, and GraphQL.
        </p>
