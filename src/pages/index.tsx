          I'm a Brazilian Full-Stack Software Engineer with 18 years of professional industry experience building full-stack web & mobile applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started my career back in 2004, and I've been working remotely from home since 2009, and exclusively for overseas companies and startups since 2013 (mostly in the U.S.).
        </p>
        <p>
          I've been leading front-end teams since 2007. First on site, then remotely, working directly with CEOs, CTOs, managers, and designers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since 2018 I have specialized in building cross-platform React apps. A single, responsive codebase running natively on iOS and Android, and on mobile and desktop web browsers, in a couple months. I believe many businesses can benefit from this tech strategy by drastically reducing costs and time to market.
        </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>
          I have experience with advanced software engineering topics such as software architecture & design, testing, design patterns, CI/CD, and with some of the greatest modern tools such as TypeScript, Jest, Node.js, Next.js, GraphQL, AWS / AppSync, Serverless Functions, Ruby / Rails, PostgreSQL, NoSQL, and more.
