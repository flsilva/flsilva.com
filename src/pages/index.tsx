          Flavio is both fast and thorough. But I was particularly struck by the deep thoughtfulness
          and helpfulness he brought to the team, and by the smile and positive spirit he shared,
          every day.

          Flavio not only has superb communication skills, but he&#39;s also a proactive problem
          solver. He will go above and beyond what is asked of him to make sure the team and the
          project will succeed.

          Flavio came in a freelance developer to help us develop a large platform MVP for a client.
          He proved himself beyond valuable in ideas and execution. I would recommend him for any
          project challenge, as he will rise to the occasion.
