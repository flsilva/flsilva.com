Schin Casa com Tudo was a successful national scoped promotion hired by soft drinks company [Schincariol (archive)](https://web.archive.org/web/20121209070623/http://www.brasilkirin.com.br/) (acquired by Kirin Japanese company in 2012).

The [Mood](http://www.agenciamood.com.br) agency (acquired by TBWA\Lew Lara) was in charge of the project and [Grafikonstruct](https://www.linkedin.com/company/grafikonstruct/) developed the interative web app.

The web app had hundreds of thousands of registered participants and more than a million registered codes on the web app.

The promotion was based on an interactive web app where participants had to register themselves through a code found in physical products of the brand (Schin soft drinks). After registration, participants could choose an empty virtual house, just like our real houses. Each registered code allowed participants to add virtual products (Car, TV, Stove, Freezer, Notebook, etc.) to their virtual houses through an isometric game engine. The winner, randomly selected by lottery, won a real house with all the added virtual products. In addition, 10.000 instant prizes were awarded right after participants registered special codes.

[Grafikonstruct](https://www.linkedin.com/company/grafikonstruct/) hired me to lead the front-end development team and coordinate the integration to the back-end system developed by an outsourced company.

I led a team of three Grafikonstruct developers to build the Adobe Flash ActionScript 3.0 client-side application. I architected the whole client-side solution based on an ActionScript 3.0 application framework I was building at the time (v1). It featured a modular architecture mainly based on the [MVC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) ([pureMVC](http://puremvc.org)) and [IoC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control) ([Spring ActionScript](https://web.archive.org/web/20120111035944/http://www.springactionscript.org/)) patterns. It also included the implementation of earlier versions of some frameworks I released afterward, including [AS3CoreAddendum](http://as3coreaddendum.org), [AS3Utils](http://as3utils.org), [AS3Collections](http://as3collections.org) and the previous version of [VostokFramework](http://vostokframework.org).

I implemented the Model, Controller, and Services layers of the app and mentored the implementation of the View layer by Grafikonstruct's team. André Anaya implemented the fantastic isometric game engine as a component of the View layer, seamlessly integrated into the AS3 framework despite its internal complexity.

Unfortunately, due to the project's complexity, there's no portfolio version, but the prints speak for themselves. Just picture lots of cool animation happening there.

Here's a nationwide TV ad that ran during the campaign:
