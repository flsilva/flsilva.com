"Fanswell connects artists and fans to book live music outside of bars and clubs. Fabric’s design and engineering team helped nurture Fanswell from napkin to product. We’re proud to say that Fanswell was successfully incubated at Fabric and has been growing steadily since the in-house team came online."

[Fabric (archive)](https://web.archive.org/web/20150817082021/http://www.fabricinteractive.com/) hired me to build the front-end web app of a custom CMS and implement their responsive landing page to support mobile devices.

Some technologies used: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
