"It is no secret that Tablets will be used as key learning tools by kids worldwide. In 2013, Pearson hired [Fabric (archive)](https://web.archive.org/web/20150817082021/http://www.fabricinteractive.com/) to help build the new Common Core software platform for K12. Fabric's team worked on the interactive content and games for Math and English and our game designers were challenged with connecting learning mechanics and pedagogy to engaging game play."

The above text was extracted from the [Fabric website (archive)](https://web.archive.org/web/20150817082021/http://www.fabricinteractive.com/#works-top) at that time.

[Fabric (archive)](https://web.archive.org/web/20150817082021/http://www.fabricinteractive.com/) hired me to team up with a very talented Poland developer to build a set of interactive educational games in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for iPad devices.

Some technologies used: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, CoffeeScript, Backbone.js, and Chaplin.js.
