An Imprint is a collection of photos, videos, and notes from friends and family for someone special. The messages become a gift that can be shared digitally and optionally turned into stylish books. Imprint Partners, Inc is an early startup behind Imprint products based in Brooklyn, NYC.

I worked remotely full-time for Imprint and had the opportunity to spend two months working in their office in Brooklyn, NYC. It was a wonderful experience to work for such a small startup, collaborating with every team member and seeing my work's massive impact on the product we were building.

Aside from working on the desktop web app, I had the chance to onboard new team members, rebuild the product landing page in a responsive way to support mobile devices, and lead the development of the product's mobile web app from scratch.

Some technologies used: JavaScript, Angular, CSS3, Ruby on Rails, and PostgreSQL.
