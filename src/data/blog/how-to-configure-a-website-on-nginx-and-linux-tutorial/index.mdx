[Nginx](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nginx) is becoming the new standard HTTP server for new websites and web apps, especially high-traffic ones.
It's blazing fast, powerful, simple, and secure.
The more we use it, the safer it becomes, as always (or almost always!).
It can handle thousands of requests per second using only 512MB RAM.

If you want to know how to install Nginx on Linux please read my article [How to install Nginx on Linux (Ubuntu & Debian)](/blog/how-to-install-nginx-tutorial-ubuntu-and-debian).

<WarningBoxNoRunDollarSign />

#### Step 1. Creating directories for your websites' configuration files

First, go to your Nginx directory.
For Ubuntu and Debian, that's _`/etc/nginx`_:

```shell
$ cd /etc/nginx
```

Now, check if the directories for the configuration files already exist by running:

```shell
$ ls -la
```

If you can see two directories named _`sites-available`_ and _`sites-enabled`_ you're good to go.
Otherwise create them by running:

```shell
$ sudo mkdir sites-available && sudo mkdir sites-enabled
```

_`sites-available`_ will contain configuration files for all websites you want to try at any time, preferably one file for each website / web app.
But files in this folder will not be _enabled_ by default, i.e., they'll not be loaded into Nginx.
That way you can safely create new files in this folder.
Then we create symbolic links into _`sites-enabled`_ folder.

That way, as a sysadmin, it's straightforward for you to enable and disable websites without having to duplicate files for backup purposes when disabling websites.
To disable a website, you just delete its symlink file using the standard _`rm`_ linux command.

Don't worry.
That's pretty easy to manage, as we'll see next.

If those directories were already there, you should see a file named _`default`_ into _`sites-available`_ and a [symlink](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link) (symbolic link) into _`sites-enabled`_.
You can look at that file if you want.
It's a template configuration file.
Anyway, I'm providing you with a fully functional one based on it below.

#### Step 2. Creating your website's configuration file

Now, let's create your website's configuration file:

<br />
(Replace _`flsilva.com.conf`_ by your domain name. Make sure your file ends with _`.conf`_)

```shell
$ sudo nano sites-available/flsilva.com.conf
```

Copy and paste the following content to your file:

```nginx
server {
  listen       80;
  server_name  www.flsilva.com;
  rewrite ^/(.*) http://flsilva.com/$1 permanent;
}

server {
  listen       80;
  server_name  flsilva.com;

  root   /var/www/flsilva.com/public;

  error_log  /var/log/nginx/flsilva.com.error.log;
  access_log  /var/log/nginx/flsilva.com.access.log;

  location / {
      index  index.html index.htm;
  }

  error_page  404              /404.html;

  # redirect server error pages to the static page /50x.html
  error_page   500 502 503 504  /50x.html;
  location = /50x.html {
      root   /var/www/flsilva.com/public;
  }

}
```

Do not forget to replace all occurences of _`flsilva.com`_ by your domain.

Save the changes by hitting **Control-X**, then **Y**, and then **Enter**.

It's a good practice to check for any common errors after changing your website config files. To do that, run the following command:

```shell
$ sudo nginx -t
```

You should get the following output:

```bash
nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok
nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful
```

Otherwise, you'll see some errors.

Next, you'll understand a little bit about this configuration file.

#### Canonical URL

The first _server_ block is there for SEO purposes.
It's a technique called canonical URL.
Here we're redirecting all requests coming to _`www.flsilva.com`_ to just _`flsilva.com`_.
If we don't take care of that, SEO ranking factors get split between more than one URL showing the same content.
Doing that (using the _permanent_ keyword, which translates to HTTP 301 status code - "Moved Permanently") we're essentially communicating to search engines that they should _always_ consider our canonical _`flsilva.com`_ URL, and that's great for SEO.

Note that you need to configure _`www`_ in your DNS service (_`www`_ is really a subdomain, like any other).
You probably want to do that because you don't want your users to see an error page if they type _`www.yourdomain.com`_, right?

But if you're creating a subdomain, you should remove this first _server_ block entirely, as your users shouldn't be typing _`www.yoursubdomain.yourdomain.com`_, but just _`yoursubdomain.yourdomain.com`_.

#### Standard port 80

This is the first line of the _server_ block:

```bash
listen       80;
```

It defines that you're exposing your website through port 80.
Port 80 is the default HTTP port.
When you use your browser to navigate the web, it'll communicate to webservers through port 80.
If you defined a different port, than you and your users would have to type the port ot access your website, like _`http://yourdomain.com:8123`_.
That's commonly used for applications to communicate with each other, but not for your end users.

#### Your domain name

The second line defines what's the URL that it handles:

```bash
server_name  flsilva.com;
```

#### Root directory

The next line defines the path for the root directory of your website:

```bash
root   /var/www/flsilva.com/public;
```

You're going to create that directory in the next step.

#### Log files

The following two lines define where Nginx will create access and error log files.
On Ubuntu and Debian, that directory is automatically created.
So Nginx will be able to create log files there.
You can look at those files to see how things are going on your website.

#### Default index file

Next are the lines that define the index file (_`index.html`_ and _`index.html`_).
You can change that if you want to use a different one.

#### 404 Error page

Next is defined a custom 404 error page (_`404.html`_), located at the website's root.
You can change the path, but if you don't have a custom error page, comment out that line, putting the _`#`_ character at the beginning of the line.

#### Internal error pages (50x status code)

The last block defines the same for 50x errors, indicating that the files will be in the root of the website.

#### Step 3. Creating your website's root directory

Now, let's create your website's root directory.
But first, an important detail: if you're not logged in as a _root_ user, and you plan to deploy your website / web app using a different user, which I recommend in my [How to securely set up a VPS server on Linux (Ubuntu & Debian)](/blog/how-to-securely-set-up-vps-server-tutorial-ubuntu-and-debian/) article, you'll also have to run the _`chown`_ command that you see next (so don't forget to replace _`deploy`_ by the username you're going to use to deploy your website).
But you shouldn't run that command if you're using your root user to log in and plan to use it to deploy.

```shell
$ cd /var
$ sudo chown deploy:deploy www
$ cd www
$ mkdir flsilva.com
$ cd flsilva.com
$ mkdir public
```

Now you just have to deploy your website to that _`public`_ directory (i.e. put your index.html file in there).

#### Step 4. Enabling your website by creating a symlink

You created your website's configuration file inside the _`sites-available`_ directory.
To make it available, we will create a [symlink](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link) for it.
A symlink is a special file containing a reference to another file.
In some situations, like this one, it's better than a simple copy & paste because you can change any file (the original one or the symlink), and both will keep in sync.
But if you delete your symlink, nothing happens to the original file.

Let's create your symlink now:

```shell
$ sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/flsilva.com.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/flsilva.com.conf
```

Don't forget to replace _`flsilva.com`_ by your domain.

PS: In my tests, that didn't work with relative paths, so make sure to use absolute ones.

That's it.
Now you should be able to see your symlink file into _`sites-enabled`_ directory pointing to the original file, like this:

```shell
flsilva.com.conf -> /etc/nginx/sites-available/flsilva.com.conf
```

If you want to disable any website configured like that, delete the symlink file and reload the Nginx's configuration file (_`nginx.conf`_ - see next steps).
You don't need to touch the files in _`sites-available`_.
And if you need to get back a website, create a new symlink again!

#### Step 5. Removing the standard _`default`_ symlink configuration file

Now remember that _`default`_ configuration file? Yep, it's working since there's a symlink created for it in the _`sites-enabled`_ folder.
For our own website to work, we need to remove it since it's also listening to the standard 80 port.

To do that run the following command:

```shell
$ sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
```

#### Step 6. Reloading Nginx

Every time you make a change to some website configuration file or even add or remove a symlink, you need to reload Nginx so it can take those changes into account.
To do that run the following command:

```shell
$ sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

You'll get an error message if there's an error in any configuration file.
Otherwise, you won't get any feedback.

And that's it.

Now you can start serving your website using the ultra fast Nginx HTTP Server.
If you have any problems or suggestions please let me know!

Following are some common configurations that you probably want to do.

#### Some optimization

_`multi_accept`_ is a configuration disabled by default.
That means a worker process will accept only one new connection at a time.
That's a waste of power, so it's useful to turn it _on_, then Nginx will accept as many connections as possible.

To do so, first open Nginx' configuration file:

```bash
$ sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```

Now, inside the block _`events {}`_ you should find it commented out like this:

```nginx
# multi_accept on;
```

Uncomment it by deleting the _`#`_ character. You should have this instead:

```nginx
multi_accept on;
```

Save the changes by hitting **Control-X**, then **Y**, and then **Enter**.

#### Allow underscores in client's request header

Another useful configuration is to allow the use of underscores by clients on _Request Headers_.
That's disabled by default but is very simple to change, and will make it a little more flexible.
To do that copy and paste the following line to your Nginx's configuration file (_`/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`_), inside the _`http{}`_ block, usually after the _`default_type    application/octet-stream;`_ line:

```nginx
underscores_in_headers   on;
```

Save the changes by hitting **Control-X**, then **Y**, and then **Enter**.

#### Avoiding the “increase server_names_hash_bucket_size error”

To avoid the _`increase server_names_hash_bucket_size error`_, which occurs for long _`server_name`_ values, first open Nginx' configuration file (_`/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`_):

```bash
$ sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```

Now, inside the block _`http {}`_ you should find it commented out like this:

```nginx
# server_names_hash_bucket_size 64;
```

Uncomment it by deleting the _`#`_ character. You should have this instead:

```nginx
server_names_hash_bucket_size 64;
```

Save the changes by hitting **Control-X**, then **Y**, and then **Enter**.

Do not forget to reload Nginx's configuration file after doing such changes:

```shell
$ sudo /etc/init.d/nginx reload
```

<br />
That's it. Please let me know if you have any questions or problems.
