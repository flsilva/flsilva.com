It's not uncommon the need to protect some content on a webserver, you might want to protect some client's content, for example, but you don't have, or want, a webapp and all the burden to implement an app level authentication.
Hopefully, Nginx provides a very simple way to protect files and directories using [HTTP Authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication).

<WarningBoxNoRunDollarSign />

#### Step 1. Installing Apache's apache2-utils

I know what you're thinking: "What? I'm not using Apache, I'm using Nginx!".
Dont' worry, I know! To use HTTP Authentication, Nginx needs a file which stores the username and encrypted password, and _htpasswd_, an Apache utility inside _apache2-utils_ package, is the easiest way to do that, although there are alternatives.
Don't worry, you're not installing the whole Apache package, just the _apache2-utils_ one.
You can [click here](https://packages.debian.org/sid/apache2-utils) to see more information about that package on [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) (probably the same package for [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/)).

If you're on macOS, Apache already comes installed, so you can skip to the next step.
If you're on a Linux system (Debian or Ubuntu), and it doesn't have Apache installed, install _apache2-utils_ running:

```shell
$ sudo apt-get install apache2-utils
```

#### Step 2. Creating a user and password

Now let's create the user and password in a new file:

```shell
$ sudo htpasswd -c /etc/nginx/.htpasswd user_a
```

In that example we're creating a `.htpasswd` file at Nginx' root directory (that's default Debian / Ubuntu Nginx location, if you're on a different system don't forget to point to the right directory).
You can choose any name and location for your file, but do not put it in a web-accessible location!
We're also adding the `user_a` to it.
Next you should be asked to put the password.

You can store any number of user/password to a single file.
To do that you just need to omit the `-c` flag.
If you do so, though, any valid user will be able to see any protected content.
So you can have more security if you store one (or a couple) users for each content you're protecting.
That's because when you protect a content, you tell Nginx to look at some file for valid users, as you'll see next.
So any user in that file will be able to see any content that points to that file.
If you have several protected URLs for different clients, and you want them to see only their content, you should create one file and one user / password for each client (in this case you can change `.htpasswd` file name by something like `.my-client-auth`).

#### Step 3. Setting up Nginx

Now you need to add some simple configuration to your website's configuration file, inside the `server {}` block.

If you want to protect a directory:

```bash
location ^~ /my-protected-directory {
    auth_basic "Restricted";
    auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/.htpasswd;
    index  index.html index.htm;
}
```

That will protect all files and directories within the directory path you provided.

If you want to protect a single file:

```bash
location ^~ /my-directory/my-file.html {
    auth_basic "Restricted";
    auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/.htpasswd;
    index  index.html index.htm;
}
```

Don't forget to change the path of your `.htpasswd` file in the `auth_basic_user_file` directive.

Now you just need to restart Nginx so your changes can take effect.

#### Step 4. Restarting Nginx

```shell
$ sudo /etc/init.d/nginx restart
```

Don't forget to change your Nginx installation path if you're not on Ubuntu / Debian.

Now when you visit your protected content your browser should prompt you a username and password.

#### Deleting a user

If you want to delete a user from a file, just run:

```shell
$ sudo htpasswd -D /etc/nginx/.htpasswd user_a
```

Where `/etc/nginx/.htpasswd` is the path of your file and `user_a` is the user to be removed.
