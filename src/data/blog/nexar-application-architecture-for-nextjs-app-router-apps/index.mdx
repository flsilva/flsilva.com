I'm excited to announce [Nexar](https://nexar.dev), an application architecture designed for Next.js App Router apps.

### What is Nexar?

Nexar is a [modular](https://flsilva.com/blog/what-is-software-architecture/#modules-and-modular-architectures) and [layered](https://flsilva.com/blog/what-is-software-architecture/#layers-and-layered-architectures) application architecture to develop scalable, maintainable, and well-organized monolith codebases with the new Next.js App Router.

I designed it to be straightforward, minimal, and pragmatic while offering [the benefits of application architectures](https://flsilva.com/blog/what-is-software-architecture/#why-software-architecture-is-important).

### Why Nexar?

<InfoBox>
  A well-defined architecture helps developers understand the system and their role in building it.
  It promotes effective communication, collaboration, and alignment with business goals across
  different teams while enforcing clear conventions.
</InfoBox>

Engineering teams work better and faster when they agree on a specific, well-defined architecture that fits their use case. Nexar provides that, assuming it fits your use case.

### OpenTask: an open-source reference implementation

I designed Nexar while building [OpenTask](https://opentask.app/), an [open-source](https://github.com/flsilva/opentask) and responsive MVP task management web application created as part of a Next.js App Router [case study](/case-studies/accelerate-your-startup-success-nextjs-app-router/) I wrote.

You can browse [OpenTask's codebase](https://github.com/flsilva/opentask) to see how it implements Nexar in its tiny details.

### Collaboration

I invite you to read Nexar's [docs](https://nexar.dev/learn), [join the discussion](https://github.com/flsilva/nexar.dev/discussions), and share your thoughts. Let's evolve it together.
