A product specification (often abbreviated as _spec_) is a document or set of documents describing what a product is, what it is supposed to do and what it is not supposed to do.
It's a key documentation and must exist for any product, even the smallest one. Working without such a documentation would be like working in the dark, and it would be impossible to define good development and testing practices.

The _spec_ has solid parameters needed to determine software's quality. Without it we are not able to state whether the software has or has not [_bugs_](/blog/what-really-is-a-software-bug/) and whether it meets the customer needs. Also, errors in the _spec_ may lead to terrible consequences because they may be carried out to development phases, which would be extremely costly to be fixed.

Nevertheless, that doesn't mean we need a large or complex **spec**.
Its complexity and type of documents varies according to the complexity of the product itself and the software development model in use. On more traditional models like [Waterfall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model), it tends to be more detailed, composed by text documents and/or [UML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language) diagrams (e.g. [requirement](http://www.sparxsystems.com/enterprise_architect_user_guide/modeling_languages/requirements_diagram.html) and [use case diagrams](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_Case_Diagram)), among other things. On modern [Agile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) models like [Scrum](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(development)>), it tends to be more succinct, and may be composed by a [Product Backlog](http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/scrum/product-backlog) and [User Stories](http://www.agilemodeling.com/artifacts/userStory.htm).
