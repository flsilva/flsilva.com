The superfast, open-source [Nginx](http://nginx.org/) HTTP webserver is becoming very popular nowadays.
Fortunately, it's very simple to install and set it up, as we'll see in this tutorial.

If you want to know about how to securely set up a Linux VPS (Ubuntu & Debian) [click here](/blog/how-to-securely-set-up-vps-server-tutorial-ubuntu-and-debian/) to read my article about just that.

#### Step 1. Updating your Linux distro

It's always a good practice to start with everything up to date, so after connecting to your server via SSH, update your Linux distro:

```shell
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade --show-upgraded
```

#### Step 2. Installing Nginx

To install Nginx run the following command:

```shell
$ sudo apt install nginx
```

#### Step 3. Checking your installation

Now let's make sure it's installed, and which version.

```shell
$ sudo nginx -v
```

You should see something like this:

_"nginx version: nginx/1.18.0"_

That should be very close to the latest version!

#### Step 4. Checking the status of Nginx

At any time you want, you can check the status of Nginx, for example, wether it's running.

Let's do that now to see if Nginx is already running. It should be as it's Debian's default behavior, but let's make sure by running the following command:

```shell
$ sudo systemctl status nginx
```

You should see a bunch of useful information, including something like this:

_Active: active (running)_

That means Nginx is up and running! ðŸ˜Ž

If you're setting up a VPS from scratch, you can now try to access its IP on your browser.
You should see something like this:

_"Welcome to nginx!"_

Congrats!
Nginx is up and listening to port 80 (HTTP).
If your server is restarted, you don't have to worry about Nginx, it'll be initialized automatically!

#### Step 5. Managing the Nginx process

You'll probably have to manage Nginx using a few commands throughout your sysadmin activities.

For example, every time you change a website configuration file, or even Nginx's configuration file, you need to reload Nginx so it can take those changes into account.
To do that, you run the following command:

```shell
$ sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

You'll get an error message if there's an error in any configuration file.
Otherwise, you won't get any feedback.

There is also the `start`, `stop` and `restart` commands that you might need at some point:

```shell
$ sudo systemctl stop nginx
```

```shell
$ sudo systemctl start nginx
```

```shell
$ sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

The `restart` command will `stop` and `start` it again.

#### Updating Nginx

You can update Nginx at any time by running:

```shell
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade nginx
```

And that's it. You can find more posts related to Nginx and sysadmin in the Related posts section below.
