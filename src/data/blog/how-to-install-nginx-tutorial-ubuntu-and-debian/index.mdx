The superfast, open-source [Nginx](http://nginx.org/) HTTP webserver is becoming very popular nowadays.
Fortunately, it's very simple to install and set it up, as we'll see in this tutorial.

If you want to know about how to securely set up a Linux VPS (Ubuntu & Debian) [click here](/blog/how-to-securely-set-up-vps-server-tutorial-ubuntu-and-debian/) to read my article about just that.

#### Step 1. Updating your Linux distro

It's always a good practice to start with everything up to date, so after connecting to your server via SSH, update your Linux distro:

```shell
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade --show-upgraded
```

#### Step 2. Installing Nginx

To install Nginc run the following command:

```shell
$ sudo apt install nginx
```

#### Step 3. Checking your installation

Now let's make sure it's installed, and which version.

```shell
$ /usr/sbin/nginx -v
```

You should see something like this:

_"nginx version: nginx/1.18.0"_

You'll be very close to the latest version!

#### Step 4. Starting and testing Nginx

Nginx is probably running by now, but if it's not just start it:

```shell
$ sudo /etc/init.d/nginx start
```

You should see something like this:

_"Starting nginx: nginx."_

If you're setting up a VPS from scratch, you can now try to access its IP on your browser.
You should see something like this:

_"Welcome to nginx!"_

Congrats!
Nginx is up and listening to port 80 (HTTP).
If your server is restarted, you don't have to worry about Nginx, it'll be initialized automatically!

#### Updating Nginx

You can update Nginx at any time by running:

```shell
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade --show-upgraded
```

#### Stopping Nginx

If you want to stop it just run:

```shell
$ sudo /etc/init.d/nginx stop
```
