The superfast, open-source [Nginx](http://nginx.org/) HTTP webserver is becoming very popular nowadays.
Fortunately, it's very simple to install and set it up, as we'll see in this tutorial.

If you want to know about how to securely set up a Linux VPS (Ubuntu & Debian) [click here](/blog/how-to-securely-set-up-vps-server-tutorial-ubuntu-and-debian/) to read my article about just that.

#### Step 1. Updating your Linux distro

It's always a good practice to start with everything up to date, so first update your Linux:

```shell
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade --show-upgraded
```

#### Step 2. Adding the Nginx official repository

To have access to the latest versions, you need to add Nginx official repository.
First you need to add Nginx repository key, so download the file:

```shell
$ wget -O ~/nginx_signing.key http://nginx.org/keys/nginx_signing.key
```

And add it to your Linux:

```shell
$ sudo apt-key add ~/nginx_signing.key
```

You should see something like: _"OK"_

Now edit the file `/etc/apt/sources.list`:

```shell
$ sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
```

Add the following two lines to it, replacing _codename_ by your Ubuntu / Debian distribution name:

A) For Ubuntu:

```bash
deb http://nginx.org/packages/ubuntu/ codename nginx
deb-src http://nginx.org/packages/ubuntu/ codename nginx
```

Ubuntu 12.04 codename: precise<br />
Ubuntu 12.10 codename: quantal<br />
Ubuntu 13.10 codename: saucy<br />
Ubuntu 14.04 codename: trusty

B) For Debian:

```bash
deb http://nginx.org/packages/debian/ codename nginx
deb-src http://nginx.org/packages/debian/ codename nginx
```

Debian 6.x codename: squeeze<br />
Debian 7.x codename: wheezy

Save the file by pressing **control X**, then **Y**, and then **Enter**.

Now update your Linux package definitions with the new Nginx repository:

```shell
$ sudo apt-get update
```

You should see some outputs but no error messages, and the following text at the end:

_"Reading package lists... Done"_

Cool, now you can finally install it!

#### Step 3. Installing Nginx

To install Nginx just run the following command:

```shell
$ sudo apt-get install nginx
```

#### Step 4. Checking your installation

Now let's make sure it's installed, and which version.

```shell
$ /usr/sbin/nginx -v
```

You should see something like this:

_"nginx version: nginx/1.6.0"_

You'll be very close to the latest version, if not on it! But if you're not, something may have failed on Step 2.
Uninstall Nginx and try again from Step 2:

```shell
$ sudo apt-get --purge remove nginx
$ sudo apt-get autoremove
```

#### Step 5. Starting and testing Nginx

Nginx is probably running by now, but if it's not just start it:

```shell
$ sudo /etc/init.d/nginx start
```

You should see something like this:

_"Starting nginx: nginx."_

If you're setting up a VPS from scratch, you can now try to access its IP on your browser.
You should see something like this:

_"Welcome to nginx!"_

Congrats!
Nginx is up and listening to port 80 (HTTP).
If your server is restarted, you don't have to worry about Nginx, it'll be initialized automatically!

#### Updating Nginx

You can update Nginx at any time by running:

```shell
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade --show-upgraded
```

#### Stopping Nginx

If you want to stop it just run:

```shell
$ sudo /etc/init.d/nginx stop
```
